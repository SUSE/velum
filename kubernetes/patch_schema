# The only reason for the existence of this script is a very nasty hack that needs to be removed
# as soon as possible.
#
# It is very closely tied to this patch existence:
# https://github.com/kubic-project/velum/blob/master/packaging/suse/patches/1_set_default_salt_events_alter_time_column_value.rpm.patch
#
# The problem
#
# We are patching the production schema. But we are mounting the development source code from the
# host. So, when we run `bin/init`, the schema that gets loaded is the one on the developers machine,
# that of course doesn't contain this patch. Without this patch, the salt-master fails to register
# events on the database, due to a missing default value on `alter_time` column.
#
# The schema salt requires is: https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/returners/all/salt.returners.mysql.html
#
# CREATE TABLE `salt_events` (
# `id` BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
# `tag` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
# `data` mediumtext NOT NULL,
# `alter_time` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
# `master_id` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
# PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
# KEY `tag` (`tag`)
# ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
#
# We are handling this table as if it was another Rails managed table, so it's in the Rails schema.
#
# So far, so good. The main problem is that Rails 4 does not support functions as default values.
# This means that if we patch the development environment, after running a migration, or running
# `db:schema:dump`, Rails won't recover this default value, and the schema it writes will be wrong.
# The good news is that this is fixed in Rails 5.
#
# Without this patch, salt-master refuses to create new salt events, with the error:
#
# [ERROR ] Could not store events - returner 'mysql.event_return' raised exception:
#          (1364, "Field 'alter_time' doesn't have a default value")
#
# The solution
#
# Use the production container that has the production schema (patched). Copy it on `/var/lib/velum`,
# since we will mount our source code in `/srv/velum` and the original `/srv/velum/db/schema.rb`
# won't be available, and then infect `bin/init` script to run `db:schema:load` with the
# `/var/lib/velum/schema.rb` schema if it exists; otherwise run a `db:load` without specifying the
# schema (that will take `/srv/velum/db/schema.rb` by default), so we don't break the default
# behavior.
#
# Commit the sles12/velum:development image again, as if nothing ever happened.
